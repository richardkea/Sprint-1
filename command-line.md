The command line is where you can type actions to your computer. You have to use particular language that the computer understands, you cannot talk to it like a human.
git init - this creates a new respository or repo. This is a place where you can store your work.
Git help - This helps find commands if you do need to do something but do not know how
Git add - this makes git aware of new files. Get is seperate from the "virtual machine" where the command line is.
git status - this checks the status of your repository. You can see what files are in it and what changes need to be commited, which in a sense makes the action complete. It also shows what branch of the repository you are working on.
git branch - When different people are working on a project, git branch gives a user the ability to go off in their own direction without effecting the master branch, which is the core piece of work. 
git checkout - lets you change between repositories, such as the master branch or the one you may have branched out to do.
git merge - merges individual changes of the collaboration together, which then effects the main piece of work or the 'master branch'.
Git push - this moves the work done on the virtual machine where the command line is to github, so it is on two different platforms.
git pull - this does the opposite to git push, it takes information saved on git to the Virtual Machine. 
git clone - this gives the user the opportunity to use their work from github and work on it through the virtual machine.
